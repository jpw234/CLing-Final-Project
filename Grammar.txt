This is just a file which holds our agreed-upon grammar for the project.
I just wanted to add it so that we had it formalized somewhere as a reference, and since
I've made a few changes as issues have arisen, it seems like a good idea.

Program = 		Command*

Command = 		Assign(Variable, Value) | If(bValue, Program, (Program)) |
				While(bValue, Program) | Print(Value) | Declare(Type, Variable)
				Return(Value)

Value = 		nValue | bValue	| String		//More will be added as we add more types, in particular Strings

nValue = 		Variable | ArithmeticOp(AOpType, nValue, nValue) | int | double

bValue = 		Variable | BooleanOp(BOpType, bValue, bValue) |
				ArithmeticRel(ARelType, nValue, nValue) | bool
